## Description

- This project was made using HTML, Javascript, Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project so that I could have a functional and working portfolio that is user-friendly for those thinking of hiring me.  It was built because I wanted there to be an easy way to access professional information about me.  It is intended to solve the problem of determining if I'm a good fit for a particular job/profession.  In making said project, I learned about react and how it can be a powerful tool for web development.
